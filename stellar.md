* 20% for distribution via the Bitcoin Program

* 5% held by SDF to support operational costs

* Inflation
`The Stellar Network has a built-in, fixed, nominal inflation mechanism. New lumens are added to the network at the rate of 1% each year. Each week, the protocol distributes these lumens to any account that gets over .05% of the “votes” from other accounts in the network.
`
* The base fee is currently set to .00001 XLM—a fraction of a fraction of a penny. The sender of the transaction incurs the fee.No one profits from the base fee. The ledger collects the fees and redistributes them in the process of inflation.


## MAJOR STELLAR CONCEPTS
`The ledger records your money as credit, which is issued by anchors. Anchors act as bridges between a given currency and the Stellar network. Banks and payment processors are good examples of real-world anchors.
`
* The Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP)

## Integration
* It typically takes between 120-200 hours of technical development, depending on the size and experience level of your developer team.


## Technology
### Horizon
`Horizon is the client-facing API server for the Stellar ecosystem. It acts as the interface between Stellar Core and applications that want to access the Stellar network. Horizon allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, and subscribe to event streams.
