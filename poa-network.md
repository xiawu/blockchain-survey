# POA Network

## Governance

Validator on-chain governance is accomplished through distributed applications (DApps) deployed to the network.

These DApps allow validators to:
* Validator Management: adding or removing validators, swapping validator keys.
* Consensus Thresholds: increasing or decreasing the number of votes required for a ballot to be approved.
* Proxy Contracts: modifying underlying smart contracts that constitute the network - may be utilized to update the network without a hard fork.
* Emission Funds: managing the emission funds - may be created every 3 months.

Unlike other models of on-chain governance, POA’s unique model relies on known, trusted individuals who use their equal voting power to protect and serve the network.

* Total number of validators: 12

### Proof of Autonomy

* Network validators are required to obtain a US notary license before they are considered for the core network.
* Each validator must use the network’s “proof of identity” decentralized applications (DApps) to prove their identity and notary status.
* each validator’s information (name, address, notary license) is publicly available.
* validators discuss the pros and cons beforehand in the POA forum

### Validator Contract

* PoA Network or ETH kovan testnet use validator-set contract to manage validators and sets of validators
