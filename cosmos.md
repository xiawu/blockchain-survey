## ecosystem

### Cosmos Hub
Delegate your ATOM to one or more of the 100 validators on the Cosmos Hub blockchain to earn more ATOM through Proof-of-Stake.

### delegator
People that cannot or do not want to operate validator nodes can still participate in the staking process as delegators
Delegators share the revenue of their validators, but they also share the risks.
To become delegators, Atom holders need to send a "Delegate transaction" where they specify how many Atoms they want to bond and to which validator.
